## Who am i?
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m going to study for a master's degree.

- ðŸ§¶ I'm also maintaining my Neovim configuration.

- ðŸ˜Ž Sometimes I also write a little experience.

## What now?
- âš¡ Fun fact: Due to personal ability issues, my Neovim configuration is basically a large number of replicas of LazyVim, with a small amount being written by myself. However, I am also unable to solve certain deep-seated problems.

- ðŸ’¬ I don't quite understand the content of Lua either.
